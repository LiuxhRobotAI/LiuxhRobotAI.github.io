In this work, we propose a high-order regularization method to solve the ill-conditioned problems in robot localization. Numerical solutions to robot localization problems are often unstable when the problems are ill-conditioned. A typical way to solve ill-conditioned problems is regularization, and a classical regularization method is the Tikhonov regularization. It is shown that the Tikhonov regularization is a low-order case of our method. We find that the proposed method is superior to the Tikhonov regularization in approximating some ill-conditioned inverse problems, such as some basic robot localization problems. The proposed method overcomes the oversmoothing problem in the Tikhonov regularization as it uses more than one term in the approximation of the matrix inverse, and an explanation for the oversmoothing of the Tikhonov regularization is given. Moreover, one a priori criterion, which improves the numerical stability of the ill-conditioned problem, is proposed to obtain an optimal regularization matrix. As most of the regularization solutions are biased, we also provide two bias-correction techniques for the proposed high-order regularization. The simulation and experimental results using an ultra-wideband sensor network in a 3-D environment are discussed, demonstrating the performance of the proposed method.
